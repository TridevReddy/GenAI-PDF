Cortés used a combination of military tactics, alliances with rival tribes, and psychological warfare to defeat the Aztecs and conquer their capital city of Tenochtitlan. He also took advantage of the Aztecs' belief in prophecy and their fear of the god Quetzalcoatl, who they believed would return in the form of a light-skinned, bearded man. By playing on these fears and manipulating the Aztecs' religious beliefs, Cortés was able to gain the upper hand and ultimately defeat them.
